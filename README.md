# MT-AKI-p-proteomics
This project contains all the scripts used to process data from a tandem mass tag HPLC-MS/MS experiment.

The experiment used protein samples extracted from the kidneys of healthy mice and mice with acute kidney injury induced by cisplatin. Phosphorylated proteins were purified from these samples prior to loading into the mass spectrometer.

Scripts for each analysis (principal component analysis - PCA, heatmap, volcano plot and enrichment) are included in Jupyter Notebooks.
